## Overview {#overview}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets Brand Portal helps you easily acquire, control, and securely distribute approved creative assets to external parties and internal business users across devices. It helps improve the efficiency of asset sharing, accelerates the time-to-market for assets, and reduces the risk of non-compliance and unauthorized access. Brand Portal allows users to browse, search, preview, download, and export assets in corporate-approved formatsâ€”anytime, anywhere.

## What's New in 6.4.3 {#what-s-new-in}

### Enhancements {#enhancements}

This release includes the following enhancements:

* Dynamic media renditions can be downloaded by the users whose AEM Author instance is running on Dynamic Media hybrid mode.
* Dynamic media renditions can be played on asset's card view and previewed on:  
1. asset details page  
  2. link share preview page  
  by the users whose AEM Author instance is running on Dynamic Media hybrid mode.

* Organizations can get their Brand Portal URL customized by having an alternate prefix or a tenant domain alias, by requesting Adobe support.  
  However, AEM Author instance can be configured only with the tenant id URL and not with tenant alias (alternate) URL.
* Publishing/ unpublishing of assets and folders from AEM (6.4.2.0) Author instance to Brand Portal can be scheduled for later.
* Non-admin users (Editors, Viewers, Guest users) can view the shared folders organized in the respective parent directory.
* Path Browser predicate introduced in Search Form to allow searching of assets in a specific directory using the search filter on Brand Portal.
* A configuration has been provided to set up Dynamic Media image server settings.

* Assets are downloaded through the link shared on email by an unintended user by copying and opening the link in an incognito browser window.
* File names of the files pulled from AEM to Brand Portal lack output encoding.
* Server banner and version are disclosed in application's HTTP response headers, thereby revealing critical information that can let attackers develop further attacks targeted at the specific version of Apache.
