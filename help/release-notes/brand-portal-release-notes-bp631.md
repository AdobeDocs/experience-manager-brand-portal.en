# Release Notes Brand Portal 6.3.1{#release-notes-brand-portal}

Release notes to be distributed to customers along with Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal 6.3.1.

## Release Information {#release-information}

| Product |Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal |
|---|---|
| Version |6.3.1 |

## Overview {#overview}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets Brand Portal is a cloud-based SaaS offering that is available as an add-on to AEM Assets (on-premise or managed service).

With Brand Portal, customers can easily distribute approved brand assets, logos, campaigns, and product assets to external agencies, partners, and internal teams in a secure way across devices.

Brand Portal allows users to browse, search, preview, download, and export assets in corporate-approved formatsâ€”anytime, anywhere.

## What's New in 6.3.1 {#what-s-new-in}

### New Features {#new-features}

This release of Brand Portal includes the following new features:

* **Digital rights management for assets**: Administrators can set the expiry date and time for assets before sharing them. After an asset expires, it is visible to viewers and editors, but it is not downloadable.  

* **Smart tags-based search**: If images with smart tags are published from AEM Assets to Brand Portal, you can search for these images in Brand Portal using the smart tag names as search keywords.  

* **Omni search**: As you start typing in a search, this feature offers suggestions that let you quickly access the relevant content, capability, or tags. Omni search is available across all search features.  

* **Metadata**: Enhanced metadata capabilities in Brand Portal provide more streamlined metadata workflows and improve the quality of metadata associated with assets.
* **Reports**: If you are an administrator, you can create and manage various asset reports including, reports around assets downloaded, expired, and published. You can choose the columns that you want displayed in a report. In addition, you can export the reports in CSV format or download them.
* **Simplified onboarding experience**: To be added to an organization, users need not accept the email invitation.
* **Ability to publish comments and tags from AEM Assets**: If the assets/collections that you publish from AEM Assets include any comments and tags, they are published along with the assets/collections. With AEM 6.3 Service Pack 1 Cumulative Fix Pack 1 (AEM SP1-CFP1), even metadata schemas, presets, and search forms are published to Brand Portal.

### Enhancements {#enhancements}

This release of Brand Portal includes the following enhancements:

* **UI and navigation**

    * The user experience is aligned with AEM through Adobe's transition to the Coral 3 user interface. This change enhances the overall usability, including navigation, and look and feel.  
    * A new column view to browse through nested folders.  
    * The folder assets list displays the latest asset at the top to indicate its recency.

* **Usability**

    * After downloading a nested folder, you can preserve the original folder hierarchy. Assets inside a nested folder are downloadable in a single folder as opposed to separate folders.  
    * Asset sorting in a folder in list view is no longer limited to the number of assets being displayed on the first page. All assets in a folder are sorted, irrespective of whether they are listed on the first page.  
    * Enhanced browse, search, and download capabilities significantly increase user efficiency.

* **Search**

    * You can add search filters to Omni search to narrow down and accelerate your search.
    * The asset rating-based search lets you search for assets with ratings, if published from AEM Assets.
    * The new multi-value search feature accepts multiple keywords with the AND operator to find assets faster.
    * The new search boost capability lets you improve the search relevance so that specific assets appear at the top of the search results.
    * The new path-based search feature lets you provide the path to a nested folder to be able to search assets in that folder.

### Critical Changes {#critical-changes}

Before using the system, review the following:

* To be able to publish tags, metadata schemas, presets, and search facets you require specific versions of AEM (AEM 6.2 SP1-CFP7 and AEM 6.3 SP1-CFP1).

* All custom changes in metadata schemas and search forms are retained. In other words, new forms of AEM 6.3 do not overwrite the existing forms. You can continue to use them as before.

### Known Issues {#known-issues}

Please contact Adobe Support for more information about the following issue:

* In the Download menu, existing image presets are not displayed.
* Editing metadata schema using Internet Explorer is not supported.  
* Post upgrade to 6.3.1, the Metadata Schema Editor form and the Edit Search Form remain the same for existing customers. New customers see the upgraded versions of the forms, which are same as AEM Assets 6.3.
