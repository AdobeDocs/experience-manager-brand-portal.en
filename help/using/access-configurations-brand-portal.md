# Administer user access on Brand Portal {#administer-user-access-on-brand-portal}

Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal 6.4.2 onwards authorizes administrators to configure guest access and enable users to request access on the Brand Portal of their organization. These configurations have been provided as **[!UICONTROL Access Settings]** configurations on the administrative panel. Both the settings are disabled by default.

**B** - Configuration to let users request access to Brand Portal using the **[!UICONTROL `Need access?`]** link on the Brand Portal welcome screen. (Default is disabled)

## Allow Guest Access {#allow-guest-access}

1. From the administrative tools panel, select **[!UICONTROL Access]** to open the **[!UICONTROL Access Settings]** page.
1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Allow Users to Request Access]** configuration.
