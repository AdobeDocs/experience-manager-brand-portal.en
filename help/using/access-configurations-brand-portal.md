# Administer user access on Brand Portal {#administer-user-access-on-brand-portal}

AEM Assets Brand Portal 6.4.2 onwards authorizes administrators to configure guest access and enable users to request access on Brand Portal of their organization. These configurations have been provided as [!UICONTROL Access Settings] configurations on the administrative panel. Both the settings are disabled by default.
