# Configure contribution folder {#configure-contribution-folder}

For collaborative asset sourcing, AEM users (administrators and non-admin users having permissions) can create new folders of type **Asset Contribution**, ensuring the new folder created is open to asset submission by Brand Portal users.  This automatically triggers a workflow which creates two additional sub folders, called **SHARED** and **NEW**, within the newly created **Contribution** folder.

AEM user then defines the asset requirements by uploading a brief about the types of assets that should be added to the contribution folder, as well as a set of baseline assets, to the **SHARED** folder to ensure Brand Portal users have the information they need. The administrator can then grant active Brand Portal users access to the contribution folder before publishing the newly created Contribution folder to Brand Portal.

The following video demonstrates, how to configure a Contribution folder in AEM Assets:
