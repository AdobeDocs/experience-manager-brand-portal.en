# Configure Contribution folder {#configure-contribution-folder}

For collaborative asset sourcing, AEM administrators/editors can create new folders in AEM Assets with an additional **Asset Contribution** property, ensuring the new folder created is open to asset submission by Brand Portal users.  This automatically triggers a workflow which creates two additional sub folders, called **SHARED** and **NEW**, within the newly created **Contribution** folder.

Administrators/editors then defines the asset requirements by uploading a brief about the types of assets that should be added to the contribution folder, as well as a set of baseline assets, to the **SHARED** folder to ensure Brand Portal users have the information they need. The administrator can then grant active Brand Portal users access to the contribution folder before publishing the newly created Contribution folder to Brand Portal.

AEM administrator/editor performs the following activities while configuring a contribution folder:

* [Create contribution folder](brand-portal-create-contribution-folder.md)
* [Upload asset requirements](brand-portal-configure-contribution-folder-properties.md)  
* [Assign contributors](brand-portal-configure-contribution-folder-properties.md)
* [Upload baseline assets](brand-portal-upload-baseline-assets.md)
* [Publish contribution folder to Brand Portal](brand-portal-publish-contribution-folder-to-brand-portal.md)
