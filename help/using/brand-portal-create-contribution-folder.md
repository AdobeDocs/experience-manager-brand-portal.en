# Create contribution folder {#create-contribution-folder}

AEM administrators and non-admin users having permission to create a new folder, can create a **Contribution** folder in AEM Assets. 
To create a **Contribution** folder, create a new folder of type **Asset Contribution**, ensuring the new folder created is open to asset submission by Brand Portal users.  This automatically triggers a workflow which creates two additional sub folders, called **SHARED** and **NEW**, within the newly created **Contribution** folder.

**To create a new contribution folder:**
1. Log in to your AEM author instance
Default URL: http:// localhost:4502/aem/start.html
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Assets > Files]**
It lists all the existing folders in the AEM Assets repository.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create a new folder. Create Folder pop-up window opens.
1. Enter **[!UICONTROL Title]** and **[!UICONTROL Name]** of the folder and mark the checkbox **[!UICONTROL Asset Contribution]**.
It is recommended to use small alphabets without space to name the folder.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

You can now configure the Contribution folder properties. See, [Configure Contribution folder properties](brand-portal-configure-contribution-folder-properties.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>A non admin user can only create and share an asset contribution folder. Once the contribution folder is created, a non admin user cannot modify or delete it.  
>
>Nesting of asset contribution folder is not supported. You can create multiple contribution folders within a folder but you must not not create a contribution folder inside another contribution folder.
