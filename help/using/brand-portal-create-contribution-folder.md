# Create contribution folder {#create-contribution-folder}


AEM administrators and non-admin users having permission to create a new folder, can create a contribution folder in AEM Assets. 
To create a contribution folder, create a new folder of type Asset Contribution, ensuring the new folder created is open to asset submission by Brand Portal users.  This automatically triggers a workflow which creates two additional sub folders, called SHARED and NEW, within the contribution folder.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create multiple contribution folders within a folder but you must not not create a contribution folder inside another contribution folder.

To create a contribution folder:
1. Log in to your AEM author instance.

   The default URL is http:// localhost:4502/aem/start.html.

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Assets]** > **[!UICONTROL Files]**. It lists all the existing folders in the AEM Assets repository.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create a new folder. **[!UICONTROL Create Folder]** dialog opens.

1. Enter **[!UICONTROL Title]** and **[!UICONTROL Name]** of the folder and select the **[!UICONTROL Asset Contribution]** check box.
It is recommended to use lowercase letters without any space to name the folder.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. You can see the contribution folder listed in the AEM Assets repository.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >A non-admin user can create and share an asset contribution folder but cannot modify or delete it.
