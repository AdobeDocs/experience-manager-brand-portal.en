# Download asset requirements {#using-asset-souring-in-bp}

Brand Portal users automatically receive pulse/email notifications whenever a contribution folder is shared by the administrators, allowing them to download the brief (asset requirement) document, as well as download the baseline assets (reference content), from the **SHARED** folder to ensure they understand the asset requirements.

Brand Portal user performs the following activities to download asset requirements:

* **Download brief**: Download the brief (asset requirement document) attached to the contribution folder which contains asset related information like type of assets, purpose, supported formats, maximum asset size, etc.
* **Download baseline assets**: Download the baseline assets which can be used to understand the types of assets required. Brand Portal users can use these assets as reference to create new assets for contribution.

Brand Portal dashboard reflects all the existing folders permitted to the Brand Portal user along with the newly shared contribution folder. In this example, the Brand Portal user only has access to the newly created contribution folder, no other existing folder is shared with the user.

**To download asset requirements:**

1. Login to your Brand Portal instance.
1. Select contribution folder from the Brand Portal dashboard.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Properties]** ![](assets/properties.png). Property window opens, displaying the Asset Contribution folder details.
