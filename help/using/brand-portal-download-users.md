Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal enhances the download experience by allowing the users to simultaneously download multiple assets and folders accessible to them from Brand Portal. This way, approved brand assets can be securely distributed for offline use. Read on to know how to download approved assets from Brand Portal, and what to expect from the [download performance](../using/brand-portal-download-users.md#expected-download-performance).

>[!NOTE]
 >
 >Install IBM Aspera Connect 3.9.9 in your browserâ€™s extension before downloading the assets from Brand Portal.
 > 

**Types of renditions in Brand Portal:**

* Original asset rendition

  It is the original binary of the asset uploaded in AEM Assets. 
  
  
* System renditions

  These are the thumbnail renditions which are automatically generated in AEM Assets based on the "DAM update asset" workflow. 
  
* Custom renditions

  These are the additional renditions that an asset might have and its dynamic renditions. Any user can create additional custom renditions, whereas, only the AEM administrator can create dynamic renditions of an image in AEM Assets. To know more, see [how to apply image presets or dynamic renditions](../using/brand-portal-image-presets.md).     


## Configure asset download {#configure-download}

The Brand Portal administrators can configure the asset **[!UICONTROL Download]** settings from the Brand Portal interface.

The available configurations are:

* **[!UICONTROL Fast Download]** 

  Enables high-speed download of the assets. To know more, see [guide to accelerate downloads from Brand Portal](../using/accelerated-download.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Custom Renditions]** 
  
  Download custom and (or) dynamic renditions of the assets. A custom rendition is a static rendition that any user can create in AEM Assets, whereas, only the AEM administrator can create dynamic renditions. To know more, see [how to apply image presets or dynamic renditions](../using/brand-portal-image-presets.md)

* **[!UICONTROL System Renditions]** 

  Download system-generated renditions of the assets. These are the thumbnails which are automatically generated in AEM Assets based on the "DAM update asset" workflow. 

Log in to your Brand Portal tenant as an administrator and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Download]**. By default, the **[!UICONTROL Fast Download]** configuration is enabled in the **[!UICONTROL Download Settings]**. 

The administrators can enable any combination to configure the asset download process.

![](assets/download-configuration.png)


Based on the configuration, the download workflow remains constant for stand-alone assets, multiple assets, folders containing assets, licensed or unlicensed assets, and downloading assets using share link. 


If all the three download configurations are turned-off, or only the **[!UICONTROL Fast Download]** configuration is enabled, the original assets are directly downloaded on your local system with no additional step required. 

If any of the **[!UICONTROL Custom Renditions]** or **[!UICONTROL System Renditions]** configuration is enabled, an additional **[!UICONTROL Download]** dialog box appears wherein you can choose whether to download the original asset along with its renditions, or download only specific renditions. 

>[!NOTE]

 >Only the administrators can download the expired assets. For more information about expired assets, see [manage digital rights of assets](../using/manage-digital-rights-of-assets.md).

     >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If you are downloading the assets for the first time and do not have IBM Aspera Connect installed in your browser, it will prompt you to install the Aspera download accelerator. 
      > 

     >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If the assets you are downloading also include licensed assets, you are redirected to the **[!UICONTROL Copyright Management]** page. In this page, select the assets, click **[!UICONTROL Agree]**, and then click **[!UICONTROL Download]**. If you choose to disagree, licensed assets are not downloaded. 
      > 
      >License-protected assets have [license agreement attached](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/assets/using/drm.html#DigitalRightsManagementinAssets) to them, which is done by setting asset's [metadata property](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/assets/using/drm.html#DigitalRightsManagementinAssets) in Experience Manager Assets.
      >

     ![](assets/licensed-asset-download-1.png)

     If any of the **[!UICONTROL Custom Renditions]** or **[!UICONTROL System Renditions]** configuration is enabled in the **[!UICONTROL Download Settings]**, the **[!UICONTROL Download]** dialog appears with the **[!UICONTROL Asset(s)]** and **[!UICONTROL Enable download acceleration]** check boxes selected by default.

     ![](assets/download-dialog.png)

     >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If the downloading assets are image files, and you select only the **[!UICONTROL Asset(s)]** check box in the **[!UICONTROL Download]** dialog but are not [authorized by the administrator to have access to the original renditions of image files](../using/brand-portal-adding-users.md#main-pars-procedure-202029708) then no image files are downloaded and a notification appears, stating that you have been restricted by the administrator to access original renditions.
      >

     ![](assets/restrictaccess-note.png)

1. To download the renditions in addition to the original assets, select the **[!UICONTROL Rendition(s)]** check box. However, if you want to download the system-generated renditions along with the custom renditions, clear the **[!UICONTROL Exclude System Renditions]** check box.

   ![](assets/download-system-rendition.png)

   * To download only the renditions, clear the **[!UICONTROL Asset(s)]** check box.

     >[!NOTE]
      >
      >By default, only the assets are downloaded. However, original renditions of image files are not downloaded if you are not [authorized by the administrator to have access to the original renditions of image files](../using/brand-portal-adding-users.md#main-pars-procedure-202029708).
      >
   
    * To share the selected assets with other users through a link, select the **[!UICONTROL Email]** check box. An email notification is sent to the users with the download link. To know how to download assets from shared links, see [downloading assets from shared links](../using/brand-portal-link-share.md#main-pars-header-1703469193).  

      ![](assets/download-link.png)

      >[!NOTE]
       >
       >The download link on email notification expires after 45 days.
       >
       >The administrators can customize email messages, that is, logo, description, and footer, using the [Branding](../using/brand-portal-branding.md) feature.
       >

    * To apply a [custom image preset to the asset and its renditions](../using/brand-portal-image-presets.md#applyimagepresetswhendownloadingimages), select the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Rendition(s)]** check box. Specify custom image preset properties (size, format, color space, resolution, and image modifier) to apply the custom image preset while downloading the asset and its renditions. To download only the dynamic renditions, clear the **[!UICONTROL Asset(s)]** check box.

      >[!NOTE]
       >
       >Brand Portal supports configuring Dynamic Media in both - Hybird and Scene 7 mode. 
       >
       >(*If AEM (Author) instance is running on **Dynamic Media Hybrid mode***)
       >To preview or download dynamic renditions of an asset, ensure that the dynamic media is enabled and the asset's Pyramid tiff rendition exists at the AEM Assets author instance from where the assets have been published. When an asset is published to Brand Portal, its Pyramid tiff rendition is also published.
       >
  
    * To preserve the Brand Portal folder hierarchy while downloading assets, select the **[!UICONTROL Create separate folder for each asset]** check box. By default, the Brand Portal folder hierarchy is ignored and all the assets are downloaded in one folder in your local system.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Download]**.

   The assets (and renditions if selected) are downloaded as a zip file to your local folder. However, no zip file is created if a single asset is downloaded without any of the renditions. 

   If you are not [authorized by the administrator to have access to the original renditions](../using/brand-portal-adding-users.md#main-pars-procedure-202029708), the original renditions of the selected assets are not downloaded. 

   >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Assets that are individually downloaded are visible in the assets download report. However, if a folder containing assets is downloaded, the folder and assets are not displayed in the assets download report.
