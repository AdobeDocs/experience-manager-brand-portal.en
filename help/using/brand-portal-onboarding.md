# First-time login experience {#first-time-login-experience}

All new Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal users, including Administrators, have the same first-time login experience.

You receive a welcome email with a link to access your organization's Brand Portal account.

Following are the steps to be performed for the users logging in to Brand Portal for the first time:

1. Open the welcome email, and click **[!UICONTROL Get Started]**.

1. In the sign-up page, specify your details (including first name, last name, password, and country/region).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you are an existing Adobe Experience Cloud user, a sign-in page is displayed instead of the sign-up page. To log in to Adobe Experience Cloud, enter your Adobe ID and password.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If your organization uses enterprise IDs, instead of viewing this sign-up page, you are redirected to the enterprise login page. For more information, see [Enterprise ID, sign in, and account help](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/enterprise/kb/enterprise-id-faq.html).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to proceed to your organization's Brand Portal page.
