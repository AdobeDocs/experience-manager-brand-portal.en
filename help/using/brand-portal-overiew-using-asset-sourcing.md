# Using Asset Sourcing {#using-asset-souring-in-bp}

Brand Portal users with appropriate permissions can upload multiple assets, or folders containing multiple assets, to the contribution folder. However, Brand Portal users are only able to upload assets to the **NEW** folder. The **SHARED** folder is meant for the distribution of baseline assets (reference content) which can be used by the Brand Portal users while creating new assets for contribution.

Brand Portal user having permission to access the contribution folder can perform the following activities:

* [Download asset requirements](brand-portal-download-asset-requirements.md)
* [Upload new assets to the contribution folder](brand-portal-upload-assets-to-contribution-folder.md)
* [Publish contribution folder to AEM Assets](brand-portal-publish-contribution-folder-to-aem-assets.md)
