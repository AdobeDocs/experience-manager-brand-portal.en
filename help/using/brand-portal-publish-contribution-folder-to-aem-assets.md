# Publish contribution folder to AEM Assets {#publish-contribution-folder-to-aem}

Brand Portal users can publish the contribution folder to AEM Assets without needing access to the AEM author instance.

Ensure that you have gone through the [asset requirements](brand-portal-download-asset-requirements.md) and upload the newly created assets in **NEW** folder within the contribution folder. See, [Upload assets to contribution folder](brand-portal-upload-assets-to-contribution-folder.md). 

**To publish contribution folder:**

1. Log in to your Brand Portal instance.
1. Select contribution folder from the Brand Portal dashboard.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Publish to AEM]** ![](assets/export.png).
![](assets/publish-contribution-folder-to-aem.png)

An email/pulse notification is sent to the Brand Portal user and AEM administrator at different stages of the publishing workflow:
1. **Queued** - When the publishing workflow triggers in Brand Portal, a contribution folder is published from Brand Portal to AEM Assets.

1. **Complete** - When the publishing workflow is complete, the contribution folder is successfully imported to AEM Assets.
