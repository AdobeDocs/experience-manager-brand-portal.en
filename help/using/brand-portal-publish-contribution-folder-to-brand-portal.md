# Publish contribution folder to Brand Portal {#publish-contribution-folder-to-brand-portal}

Once the [contribution folder is configured](brand-portal-configure-contribution-folder-properties.md), AEM user (administrator/non-admin user) can publish the contribution folder from AEM Assets to Brand Portal.

**To publish contribution folder:**

1. Log in to your AEM author instance.
Default URL: http:// localhost:4502/aem/start.html
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Assets > Files]** and locate the contribution folder in which you want to publish to Brand Portal.
1. Select contribution folder and click **[!UICONTROL Quick Publish > Publish to Brand Portal]**.
