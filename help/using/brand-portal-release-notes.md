## Release Information {#release-information}

| Product |Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal |
|---|---|
| Version | 6.4.5|
| Date | September 2019 |

## Overview {#overview}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets Brand Portal helps you easily acquire, control, and securely distribute approved creative assets to external parties and internal business users across devices. It helps improve the efficiency of asset sharing, accelerates the time-to-market for assets, and reduces the risk of non-compliance and unauthorized access. Brand Portal allows users to browse, search, preview, download, and export assets in corporate-approved formatsâ€”anytime, anywhere.

## What's New in 6.4.5 {#what-s-new-in-645}

### New Features {#new-features-645}

Brand Portal 6.4.5 is a feature release that focuses on providing Brand Portal users (external agencies/teams) with the ability to upload content to Brand Portal and publish to AEM Assets, without needing access to the author environment. This feature is called **[Asset Sourcing in Brand Portal](brand-portal-overiew-using-asset-sourcing.md)**, and will improve customer experiences by providing a two-way mechanism for users to both contribute and share assets with other globally distributed Brand Portal users.

**Asset Sourcing in Brand Portal**

Asset Sourcing allows AEM users (administrators/non-admin users) to create new folders with an additional **Asset Contribution** property, ensuring the new folder created open to asset submission by Brand Portal users. This automatically triggers a workflow which creates two additional sub folders, called NEW and SHARED, within the newly created **Contribution** folder.

The AEM user then defines the asset requirements by uploading a brief about the types of assets that should be added to the contribution folder, as well as a set of baseline assets, to the **SHARED** folder to ensure BP users have the reference information they need. The administrator can then grant active Brand Portal users access to the contribution folder before publishing the newly created **Contribution** folder to Brand Portal.

Once the user is finished adding content in the **NEW** folder, they can publish the contribution folder back to the AEM author environment.
