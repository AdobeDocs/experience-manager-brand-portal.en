# Share collections on Brand Portal {#share-collections-bp}

AEM Assets Brand Portal Administrators can share and unshare a collection or a smart collection with authorized users. Editors can view and share only the collections created by them, shared with them, and public collections. However, editors cannot change a public collection to a non-public collection.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Editors cannot change a public collection to a non-public collection and, therefore, do not have [!UICONTROL Public Collection] checkbox available in [!UICONTROL Collection Settings] dialog.

## Share a collection {#share-collection}

To share a collection, follow these steps:

1. Click the overlay icon on the left, and choose **[!UICONTROL Navigation]**.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Collection Settings] dialog box, select the users or groups with whom you want to share the collection and select the role for a user or a group to match their global role. For example, assign the Editor role to a global editor, the Viewer role to a global viewer.

   Alternatively, to make the collection available to all users irrespective of their group membership and role, make it public by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Public Collection]** check-box.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >However, non-admin users can be restricted from creating public collections, to avoid having numerous public collections so that system space can be saved. Organizations can disable the **[!UICONTROL Allow public collections creation]** configuration from [!UICONTROL General] settings available in admin tools panel.

   Editors cannot change a public collection to a non-public collection and, therefore, do not have [!UICONTROL Public Collection] check-box available in [!UICONTROL Collection Settings] dialog.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add]**, and then **[!UICONTROL Save]**. The collection is shared with the chosen users.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >A user's role governs access to the assets and folders inside a collection. If a user does not have access to assets, an empty collection is shared with the user. Also, a user's role governs the actions available for collections.

## Unshare a collection {#unshare-a-collection}

To unshare a previously shared collection, do the following:

1. From the [!UICONTROL Collections] console, select the collection you want to unshare.

   In the toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]**.

   ![](assets/collection_settings.png)

1. On the [!UICONTROL Collection Settings] dialog box, under [!UICONTROL Members], click the **[!UICONTROL x]** symbol next to users or groups to remove them from the list of users you shared the collection with.

1. In the warning message box, click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** to confirm unshare.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

1. Log in to Brand Portal with the credentials of the user you removed from the shared list. The collection is removed from the **[!UICONTROL Collections]** console.
