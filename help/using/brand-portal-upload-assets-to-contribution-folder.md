# Upload assets to contribution folder {#uplad-new-assets-to-contribution-folder}

Brand Portal users [download the asset requirements](brand-portal-download-asset-requirements.md) – brief document attached to the contribution folder and download baseline assets from the **SHARED** folder to understand the need of contribution. 
Brand Portal users can then create new assets for contribution and upload them to the **NEW** folder within the contribution folder.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Brand Portal users can upload content/assets only to the **NEW** folder. They do not have permission to delete an uploaded asset.
>
>Maximum upload limit for any Brand Portal account/tenant is **10** GB.


**To upload new assets:**

1. Login to your Brand Portal instance.

1. Click to open the contribution folder, you can see two sub folders–**[!UICONTROL SHARED]** and **[!UICONTROL NEW]** within the contribution folder.
