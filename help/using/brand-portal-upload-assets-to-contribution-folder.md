# Upload new Assets to Contribution folder in Brand Portal {#uplad-new-assets-to-contribution-folder}

Brand Portal users create new assets based on the asset requirement document attached to the contribution folder and baseline assets in the **SHARED** folder.  Once new assets are ready, Brand Portal users upload them to the **NEW** folder.

**To upload new assets:**

1. Login to your Brand Portal instance.
Brand Portal dashboard reflects all the existing folders permitted to the Brand Portal user along with the newly shared contribution folder.
1. Click to open the contribution folder, you can see two sub foldersâ€“**[!UICONTROL SHARED]** and **[!UICONTROL NEW]** within the contribution folder.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL NEW]** folder.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create > Files]** to upload individual files or folder (.zip) containing multiple assets.
1. Browse and upload new assets (files/folders) in the **[!UICONTROL NEW]** folder.

Once upload is finished, Brand Portal user can publish the contribution folder back to AEM Assets. See, [Publish contribution folder to AEM Assets](brand-portal-publish-contribution-folder-to-aem-assets.md).
